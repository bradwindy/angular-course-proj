## About
This repo is a test project I created to learn how to implement aspects of continuous integration and testing with Angular. 

I have used Travis CI and Code Climate to implement code coverage, tslint checking and testing using Karma. 
The tests are in the file app.component.spec.ts. Currently there are not many, but I plan to write more in the future.

The project gets automatically checked after a push, then if all checks and tests pass, the project is built and 
deployed to GitHub Pages. 

If you like this project, check out my website to read more about me.

This code is licensed under GPL-3.0. It's open source!
